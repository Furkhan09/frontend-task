       <b> <P>Who was Muhammed Ali?</P>
        <p>Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist and social activist who is universally regarded as one of the 
        greatest athletes of the 20th century. Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world heavyweight 
        boxing champion in 1964. Following his suspension for refusing military service, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight
        title two more times during the 1970s, winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier and George Foreman along the way. 
        Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, Ali devoted much of his time to philanthropy, earning the Presidential
        Medal of Freedom in 2005.
